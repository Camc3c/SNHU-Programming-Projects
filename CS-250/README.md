Portfolio Reflection: Sprint Review and Retrospective

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?:

Interpreting user needs involves having communication with stakeholders and customers to gather requirements through direct feedback.
Creating user stories helps the team break down those needs into clear goals.
It ensures that every feature built connects back to what the user actually wants.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?:

Flexibility and constant communication are key to good development.
I plan to integrate Agile practices into future projects.
The processes used in Agile development allow teams to adapt quickly to changes without losing progress on the project.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?:

Being a good team member means communicating openly, adapting to change, and supporting others to reach development goals.
It requires listening, helpinh with blockers, and making sure the team remains on goal.
Collaboration and trust are key to success in Agile teams.
