Portfolio Reflection: Sprint Review and Retrospective

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Interpreting user needs involves active communication with stakeholders to gather requirements, often through direct feedback.
Creating user stories helps by breaking down those needs into clear, actionable goals that guide development.
It ensures that every feature built connects back to what the user actually wants.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I approach development by focusing on flexibility and constant communication. 
I plan to continue using Agile practices like iterative development, daily standups, backlog grooming, and sprint retrospectives.
These processes allow teams to adapt quickly to changes without losing progress and keep the user at the center of the project.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member means communicating openly, adapting to change, and supporting others to reach team goals.
It requires active listening, helping remove blockers, and making sure the team remains aligned with the project vision.
Collaboration and trust are key to success in Agile teams.
