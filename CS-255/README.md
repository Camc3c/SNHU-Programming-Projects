Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The client, DriverPass, wanted a cloud-based system for students to register, choose driving lesson packages, schedule lessons, take practice tests, and track progress. The system also needed administrative features and DMV integration.

What did you do particularly well?
I clearly mapped user requirements into UML diagrams, especially the use case and class diagrams, making sure all system roles and actions were accurately represented.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise the class diagram to better support package versioning so that past reservations stay accurate even if packages change later.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I used the interview transcript to guide each design decision, ensuring the system solved real problems. Understanding user needs is key to building software that’s both useful and usable.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I begin with use cases, then build out activity, sequence, and class diagrams. In the future, I would add user stories and version control for diagrams to support better collaboration and updates.
